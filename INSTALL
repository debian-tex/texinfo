For generic installation instructions on compiling and installing this
Automake-based distribution, please read the file `INSTALL.generic'.

Installation notes specific to Texinfo:

* texinfo.tex and the other *.tex files are not installed by
  `make install', because there is no reliable way to know where to
  install them.  Instead, you have to run an additional make command
  after the normal make install:
    make TEXMF=/your/texmf install-tex
  texinfo.tex is installed in ${TEXMF}/tex/texinfo/texinfo.tex, etc.

* On the other hand, if you're maintaining a TeX distribution and
  keeping the files up to date yourself, you may not want to see the
  installation warnings.
  For that, run configure --disable-install-warnings, or set
  enable_install_warnings=no in the environment.

* The `makeinfo' program is a Perl program that can use extension
  modules, known as XS modules.  The configure script will attempt to
  detect whether such modules can be built and loaded on your
  installation.  If you want to disable the use of XS modules, you can
  give the --disable-perl-xs flag to `configure'; likewise, to use them
  without checking, give the --enable-perl-xs flag.  Some of the
  environment variables listed in the output of `./configure --help' may
  be of use for building the XS modules.
      After building the program, the use of XS modules can be
  controlled with the `TEXINFO_XS' environment variable, which may be
  useful for troubleshooting.  Set TEXINFO_XS=debug to print some
  information as the modules are looked for and loaded, TEXINFO=omit to
  disable their use, and TEXINFO_XS=required to force their use.

* For instructions on compiling this distribution with DJGPP tools
  for MS-DOS and MS-Windows, see the file djgpp/README.

* The Info tree uses a file `dir' as its root node; the `dir-example'
  file in this distribution is included as a possible starting point.
  Use it, modify it, or ignore it just as you like.

* You can create a file texinfo.cnf to be read by TeX when
  processing Texinfo manuals.  For example, you might like to use
  @afourpaper by default.  See the `Preparing for TeX' node in
  the Texinfo manual for more details.  You don't have to create the
  file if you have nothing to put in it.
