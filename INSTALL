For generic installation instructions on compiling and installing this
Automake-based distribution, please read the file `INSTALL.generic'.

Installation notes specific to Texinfo:

* texinfo.tex and the other *.tex files are not installed by `make
  install'.  This is because there is no reliable way to know where to
  install them.  Instead, you have to run an additional make command
  after the normal make install:
    make TEXMF=/your/texmf install-tex
  texinfo.tex is installed in ${TEXMF}/tex/texinfo/texinfo.tex, etc.

* On the other hand, if you're maintaining a TeX distribution and
  keeping the files up to date yourself, you may not want to see the
  installation warnings.
  For that, run configure --disable-install-warnings, or set
  enable_install_warnings=no in the environment.

* For instructions on compiling this distribution with DJGPP tools
  for MS-DOS and MS-Windows, see the file djgpp/README.

* The Info tree uses a file `dir' as its root node; the `dir-example'
  file in this distribution is included as a possible starting point.
  Use it, modify it, or ignore it just as you like.

* You can create a file texinfo.cnf to be read by TeX when
  processing Texinfo manuals.  For example, you might like to use
  @afourpaper by default.  See the `Preparing for TeX' node in
  texinfo.txi for more details.  You don't have to create the file if
  you have nothing to put in it.
