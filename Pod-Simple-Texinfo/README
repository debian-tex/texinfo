DISTRIBUTION SETUP

This module is usually distributed as part of GNU Texinfo, using Autoconf
and Automake for the build system.  Alternatively, it is possible to
distribute the module using Makefile.PL as described here.

The pod2texi script is usually set up using the Autoconf and Automake
built environment from pod2texi.pl.  When using Makefile.PL, the
pod2texi.pl file can be copied instead.  In that case, the Texinfo::Parser
modules will not be searched for as in the GNU Texinfo usual case, only
in the perl paths, as in other perl modules.

   cp pod2texi.pl pod2texi
