Pod-Simple-Texinfo version 0.01
===============================

Pod::Simple based Pod formatter to render Texinfo.

INSTALLATION

To install from version control sources, the pod2texi script needs to be
created first.  This is not needed from code archives.

   cp pod2texi.pl pod2texi

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

Pod::Simple::PullParser, Pod::Simple::XHTML, Texinfo::Parser.

DISTRIBUTION SETUP

This module is usually distributed as part of GNU Texinfo, using Autoconf
and Automake for the build system.  Alternatively, it is possible to
distribute the module using Makefile.PL as described here.

The pod2texi script is usually set up using the Autoconf and Automake
built environment from pod2texi.pl.  When using Makefile.PL from version
control sources, the pod2texi.pl file should be copied instead, as explained
above.  In that case, the Texinfo::Parser modules will not be searched for as
in the GNU Texinfo usual case, only in the perl paths, as in other perl
modules.

The test_scripts/*.sh test scripts are setup to work with the Autoconf and
Automake built environment, they are not distributed when using Makefile.PL.
To be able to run them manually from version control sources when using
Makefile.PL, you can do something like the following, with a sed command
that understands -i to modify the scripts such that they do not need the
defs file present in the Autoconf and Automake built environment:
for script in test_scripts/*.sh; do
  sed -i -e 's;^\. \$testdir/\.\./tp/defs.*;#&\nPERL=perl;' $script;
done
