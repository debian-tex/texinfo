This file describes the development environment for Texinfo.

The development sources for GNU Texinfo are available through anonymous
CVS at Savannah:
  http://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=texinfo

This distribution uses whatever versions of Automake, Autoconf, and
Gettext are listed in NEWS; usually the latest official releases.  If you
are getting the sources from CVS (or change configure.ac), you'll need
to have these tools installed to (re)build.  You'll also need help2man.
All of these programs are available from http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu.

After getting the CVS sources, and installing the tools above, you can run
 ./autogen.sh
and then, for example,
 ./configure -C CFLAGS='-g -Wdeclaration-after-statement'
and then
 make

After the initial autogen && configure, simply running make should suffice.

The -C tells configure to cache test results, which usually speeds
things up a bit.

That particular -W is useful because a) intermixing declarations with
statements is an easy thing to do accidentally, b) gcc doesn't warn
about it by default, and c) other compilers that don't support it are
still widespread.  If you're not using gcc, of course you shouldn't
specify that option.

Other -W options can be useful too, and patches are welcome to resolve
diagnostics; however, removing all possible warning messages, or
warnings with nonfree compilers, is explicitly not a goal.

If you want to delve into making a new backend for the Perl makeinfo,
the documentation in tp/Texinfo/Convert/Converter.pm is a good starting
point, as it describes the existing backends and other places to look.

Translations are handled through the Translation Project.  When a new
.po is posted in
  http://translationproject.org/latest/texinfo 
  http://translationproject.org/latest/texinfo_document
it should be installed.

This distribution also uses Gnulib (http://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib)
to share common files.  Gnulib files used in Texinfo are checked in to
CVS.  If you get automake/conf/etc. errors from ./autogen.sh, please try
doing a CVS checkout of gnulib (in a separate directory from the texinfo
checkout), and then run, say,
  ../gnulib/gnulib-tool --add-import
in your top-level Texinfo directory.  (gnulib-tool is in the gnulib CVS tree.)

The currently-used gnulib modules and other gnulib information are
recorded in gnulib/m4/gnulib-cache.m4.  Given a source checkout of
gnulib, you can update the files with gnulib-tool --add-import.



About running the Texinfo programs from a development source tree:

- Once the distribution is built, you can run the compiled programs
(info, texindex, install-info) out of the build tree without special
settings; they don't try to read any installed data files.

- The texi2dvi script and texinfo.tex can be run as-is, since they 
are standalone and don't require compilation.  For the same reasons,
they are officially updated between full Texinfo releases, at
http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/texinfo.

- Regarding texi2any (aka makeinfo), you can run tp/texi2any.pl
directly.  This is the original source file for the program, so it's
convenient to be able to make changes and then run it.

To run it under a name that doesn't end in .pl, e.g., "makeinfo", you
can set the environment variable TEXINFO_DEV_SOURCE to 1, or symlink to
a trivial script:
#!/bin/sh
exec /YOUR/TEXINFO/DIR/tp/texi2any.pl "$@"



Steps for making a release (pretest or official):

- First checks:
ensure texinfo.tex, texi2dvi, and htmlxref.cnf are updated on ftp.gnu.org.
ensure TXI_XLATE in doc/Makefile.am matches actual file list.

- Official releases only:
version number in texi2dvi, texi2pdf, txirefcard.tex.
sync texi2html/test/ results with tp/.
ensure building standalone modules for CPAN still works.
make dvi and fix underfull/overfull boxes.
specially plead with bug-texinfo / beebe / compile farms to try.
try groff.texinfo from groff source repo.

- Changes to sources:
update version in configure.ac, ChangeLog; NEWS with date if official.
gnulib-tool --add-import
util/srclist-txi
pod2man Pod-Simple-Texinfo/pod2texi.pl >man/pod2texi.1 # until we fix deps
make
make po-check             # update po/POTFILES.in as needed
make -C po update-po      # but don't commit yet, dist updates po_document
make -C doc wwwdoc-build  # and eventually -install, for official.
(export MALLOC_CHECK_=2; make distcheck)  # repeat until clean
svn commit                # when clean, then distcheck to be sure.
#create diff  for official, see below 

- To do the actual upload:
pkg=texinfo
ver=5.0.91

then do one of:
gnupload --to alpha.gnu.org:$pkg $pkg-$ver.tar.xz                #pretest
gnupload --to ftp.gnu.org:$pkg   $pkg-$ver.tar.{gz,xz} *.diff.gz #official

and the corresponding, to save in local archives:
mv -v $pkg-$ver.tar.xz* $misc/archive/$pkg/alpha/           #pretest
mv -v $pkg-$ver.tar.{gz,xz}* *.diff.gz $misc/archive/$pkg/  #official

For pretest release, send announcement to bug-texinfo.

- When official release is out there ...
  ... update DTD and web pages:
cd $HOME/gnu/www/texinfo/dtd # or wherever webpages checkout is
mkdir $ver; cvs add $ver
cp $tutil/texinfo.dtd $ver
cvs add $ver/texinfo.dtd
cvs com -m$ver $ver

update home page (texinfo.html) and commit as needed.
update manual, including:
  pod2html Pod-Simple-Texinfo/pod2texi.pl >pod2texi.html

  ... tag source tree:
cvs tag -b texinfo_`echo $ver | tr . _`

  ... update texinfo at tug.org (contact root@tug.org); from last time:
prev=4.13
ver=5.0
cd ~ftp/tex
rm -rf texinfo-$prev*
cp ~/src/texinfo/texinfo-$ver.tar.{gz,xz} .
tar xzf texinfo-$ver.tar.gz
ln -s texinfo-$ver.tar.gz texinfo.tar.gz
!!:gs/gz/xz
relink texinfo $ver

  ... announcements:
news item at savannah.
send announcement to info-gnu, cc bug-texinfo.

  ... make diffs at official release:
  prev=4.13
  ver=5.0
  cd $xarchive/../prod
  tar xf texinfo-$ver.tar.gz
  tar xf texinfo-$prev.tar.gz
  diff -Nrc2 texinfo-$prev texinfo-$ver | xz >texinfo-$prev-$ver.diff.xz
  gnupload --to ftp.gnu.org:texinfo !$
  rm -rf texinfo-$ver texinfo-$prev
  ro texinfo-*$ver*
