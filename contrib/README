They are all free software, but not officially part of Texinfo, and the
Texinfo maintainers don't support them (and generally have no knowledge
about them, just passing them on).

The texifont/ subdirectory was an attempt at implementing a generalized
font system, but it remains incomplete.  See the README there.

In contrast, the two txipsfonts-* files are attempts by Torsten Bronger
and Stephen Gildea, respectively, to use base PostScript fonts instead
of Computer Modern, in the simplest way.  (I could not find the right
version of the original texinfo.tex on which Torsten's file was based.)
Adapting one of these to actually be installable would doubtless be much
simpler (which is not to say simple) than finalizing texifont/, though
of course much less featureful.

The perldoc-all subdirectory is about making Texinfo out of the standard
Perl *.pod files.  The results are at
http://www.gnu.org/software/perl/manual.
