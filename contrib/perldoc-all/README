This stuff is about making Texinfo out of the standard Perl *.pod files.
The results are at http://www.gnu.org/software/perl/manual.

The idea is to download the perl distribution here, as in,
  wget http://www.cpan.org/src/5.0/perl-5.16.2.tar.gz
and run (GNU) make.  Aside from the result hopefully being useful in
itself, it also serves as a nontrivial example of using pod2texi.
