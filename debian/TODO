TODO for texinfo Debian package
-------------------------------
* use libpaper/papersize to set /etc/texmf/tex/whatever/texinfo.cnf to
  include @afourpaper in case that papersize=a4. Needs some checking
  like a grep for % ___USE_PAPERSIZE___ in it...

* fix the man page for makeinfo to include --document-language

* fix the @documentlanguage callback function in makeinfo to change
  the interface_language variable.

* `merge' Debian install-info and GNU install-info, it is a pain in the a.

* go through the bugs on bugs.debian.org and check wether they are
  still present or fixed already (by upstream).
