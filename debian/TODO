TODO for texinfo Debian package
-------------------------------
* `merge' Debian install-info and GNU install-info, it is a pain in the a.

* go through the bugs on bugs.debian.org and check wether they are
  still present or fixed already (by upstream).

DONE
----
* Bug 352630: we have to check wether tetex|texlive is already configured,
  the which fmtutil-sys test is not good enough, as the kpsewhich might
  not run since the libkpathsea is not configured and useable.
