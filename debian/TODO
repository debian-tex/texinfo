TODO for texinfo Debian package
-------------------------------
* go through the bugs on bugs.debian.org and check wether they are
  still present or fixed already (by upstream).
* dh_install: debian/tmp/usr/share/texmf/pdftex/plain/misc/pdfcolor.tex exists in debian/tmp but is not installed to anywhere
* fix priority of texinfo, as it suggests tetex|texlive which are optional
  while texinfo is standard
