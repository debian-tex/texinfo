TODO for texinfo Debian package
-------------------------------
* go through the bugs on bugs.debian.org and check wether they are
  still present or fixed already (by upstream).
* check on suggests: 
	texlive:	-langcyrillic
			-basic(bin)?
	tetex:		-base
			-extra?
* fix postinst scripts, do not call --missing ?? What did break at
  texlive install-remove-install cycle?
