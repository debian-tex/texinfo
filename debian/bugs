	there is already a wontfix and a upstream tag

146133 Matching vs. Searching
151850 Matching vs. Searching
	still present in 4.8, cvs I don't know

147483: texinfo: wrong PDF bookmarks are generated
	yes. subsubsection without subsection within a section does two
	things: it is not displayed in the right order
	and it does no jump to the right place in the file for the subsubsect
	bookmark in html

DONE 150710 crashes on various locales when pressing Ctrl-h
DONE 199615: info: unexpected death on pressing `?' key
	fixed by regeneration of po files
	done for 4.8-2

204117 texinfo: texinfo.dtd poorly installed
	have to read up about this

212549 info should support the "coding" local variable and output correct characters
	no idea what it means

214729: makeinfo --html should generate valid HTML
	correct, the DOCTYPE is missing, should be sent upstream

218557: dies with "Cannot find node `Top'"
	still present, quite interesting, zeros in dir file. Should be
	taken a look at
	[1] I think this could be in build_tags_and_nodes(), in info/nodes.c,
	where the file is already in memory and is parsed for expected
	structures.  There we could stuff some error returning code, the
	function simply doesn't update any error flag.
	I have gdbed a run through the function, and while parsing
	/usr/share/info/dir, it simply did not find the end of the TAGS_TABLE
	(at line 402), and called get_nodes_of_info_file().
	  This get_nodes_of_info_file() function has the same problem, it
	doesn't return an useful error but aborts at the first while loop since
	find_node_separator() fails (scans the whole file to find a "node
	start").
	  End result: build_tags_and_nodes parses for tags, but does not report
	problems, and build_tags_and_nodes parses for nodes (by calling a
	helper), but doesn't report problems encountered there neither.

	[2] For example, with my corrupted file still in place:
	bee# install-info --quiet --section "Disk Management" "Disk Management" /usr/share/info/parted.info.gz && echo success success
	bee# info parted
        info: Cannot find node `Top'.
	-------------------------------------------------------------------
	Concerning [1]: This could also fix the problem of bug 234848 where
	the man page of top is shown instead of the TOP (dir)
	Concerning [2]: Bug should be cloned and reassigned to the program
	providing install-info, i.e. dpkg.
