Bookmark bugs
=============
37515: texi2pdf retitled, bookmarks in appendices are wrong
	bookmarks are done, but in the appendix do not jump to the right
	place
	RELATED to 147483 subsubsection without subsection ???
	also present in cvs!

In the testfile we have the following bookmarks:
appendix A: first appendix
A.1	first section of appendix
A.1.1	subsection
A.2	second section of appendix
A.3	third section of appendix.
Unfortunately the jumping of bookmarks is simple, but wrong. It ALWAYS jumps
to the top of the (right) page. So at least the page is correct ;-)
(even with current cvs texinfo.tex)

147483: texinfo: wrong PDF bookmarks are generated
	yes. subsubsection without subsection within a section does two
	things: it is not displayed in the right order
	and it does no jump to the right place in the file for the subsubsect
	bookmark in html

The attached texi files generates together with the texinfo.tex from current
cvs several errors:
(bug 147483) subsubsection without subsection within a section
We have 
	chapter 2	Command reference
	section 2.1	Commands from libxmms
	subsubsection 2.1.0.1	subsubsection without subsection
Now in the Table of contents this is ok
But the pdf bookmarks in acroread/xpdf are wrong, namely the show
subsubsection 2.1.0.1 on the same level as section 2.1, as direct children
of chapter 2.

Forthermore, clicking on the bookmarks of section 2.1 brings the respective
line properly to the top of the reader windows. But clicking on the
bookmark of subsubsection 2.1.0.1 "subsection without section" brings
me to the top of the page (or to the same place as Chapter 2?)

78504:	wishlist on movement

113988: makeinfo: locale settings should not influence output files
	forwarded upstream, version 4.0, need check!
	long discussion on the bug, but no conclusion

115503: texi2dvi: source file directory included in search path
	forwarded upstream, version 4.0, need check!
	upstream: wontfix. How to deal with bugs like this?
	there is already a wontfix and a upstream tag
	TODO: write email to submitter whether he considers this still
	a bug or whether I can close the bug?

146133 Matching vs. Searching
151850 Matching vs. Searching
	TODO:
	- unmerge the two bugs
	- reassign one (probably 151850) to python2.1-doc
	- retitle this one: node names must not contain dots
	- retitle the other: would be nice to use dots in nodenames
	- severity of the other: wishlist
	this is a wishlist, as the texinfo documentation 6.3.2 explicitely
	states that node names must not contain dots.
	splitted into two, one reassigned back to python2.1-doc, one
	downgraded to wishlish

	The proposed bug fix generates problems: In the dir file and other
	places the final . is sometimes included in the node name, what
	shouldn' happen, eg (cvs.info)Index
		* -j (merging branches), and keyword substitution: Merging and keywords.
                                                            (line   6)
	produces
	Knoten »Merging and keywords.« nicht gefunden.
	So, forget this one. Basta. 
	won't fix I guess

204117 texinfo: texinfo.dtd poorly installed
	have to read up about this
	use dh_installxmlcatalog and check the rules file for
	libglade2-0: /usr/share/xml/libglade/glade-2.0.dtd
	sgml-data: /usr/share/xml/qaml/qaml-xml.dtd
	on how to install this one
	Debian SGML/XML HOWTO http://www.debian.org/doc/misc-manuals#sgml-howto
	Debian XML Policy (if already exists)

212549 info should support the "coding" local variable and output correct characters
	no idea what it means

214729: makeinfo --html should generate valid HTML
	correct, the DOCTYPE is missing, should be sent upstream

218557: dies with "Cannot find node `Top'"
	still present, quite interesting, zeros in dir file. Should be
	taken a look at
	[1] I think this could be in build_tags_and_nodes(), in info/nodes.c,
	where the file is already in memory and is parsed for expected
	structures.  There we could stuff some error returning code, the
	function simply doesn't update any error flag.
	I have gdbed a run through the function, and while parsing
	/usr/share/info/dir, it simply did not find the end of the TAGS_TABLE
	(at line 402), and called get_nodes_of_info_file().
	  This get_nodes_of_info_file() function has the same problem, it
	doesn't return an useful error but aborts at the first while loop since
	find_node_separator() fails (scans the whole file to find a "node
	start").
	  End result: build_tags_and_nodes parses for tags, but does not report
	problems, and build_tags_and_nodes parses for nodes (by calling a
	helper), but doesn't report problems encountered there neither.

	[2] For example, with my corrupted file still in place:
	bee# install-info --quiet --section "Disk Management" "Disk Management" /usr/share/info/parted.info.gz && echo success success
	bee# info parted
        info: Cannot find node `Top'.
	-------------------------------------------------------------------
	Concerning [1]: This could also fix the problem of bug 234848 where
	the man page of top is shown instead of the TOP (dir)
	Concerning [2]: Bug should be cloned and reassigned to the program
	providing install-info, i.e. dpkg.

228606 makeinfo --html: split by chapter
	wish list, I cannot do anything with it

234848 info: Unexpected behaviour when trying to (incorrectly) open a file
	this is true, it shows the man page of top, which is rubbish
