DONE for 4.8-7 
113988: makeinfo: locale settings should not influence output files
	forwarded upstream, version 4.0, need check!
	long discussion on the bug, but no conclusion

115503: texi2dvi: source file directory included in search path
	forwarded upstream, version 4.0, need check!
	upstream: wontfix. How to deal with bugs like this?
	there is already a wontfix and a upstream tag
	TODO: write email to submitter whether he considers this still
	a bug or whether I can close the bug?

204117 texinfo: texinfo.dtd poorly installed
	asked on debian-devel

212549 info should support the "coding" local variable and output correct characters
	no idea what it means

214729: makeinfo --html should generate valid HTML
	wait response from Karl

218557: dies with "Cannot find node `Top'"
	still present, quite interesting, zeros in dir file. Should be
	taken a look at
	[1] I think this could be in build_tags_and_nodes(), in info/nodes.c,
	where the file is already in memory and is parsed for expected
	structures.  There we could stuff some error returning code, the
	function simply doesn't update any error flag.
	I have gdbed a run through the function, and while parsing
	/usr/share/info/dir, it simply did not find the end of the TAGS_TABLE
	(at line 402), and called get_nodes_of_info_file().
	  This get_nodes_of_info_file() function has the same problem, it
	doesn't return an useful error but aborts at the first while loop since
	find_node_separator() fails (scans the whole file to find a "node
	start").
	  End result: build_tags_and_nodes parses for tags, but does not report
	problems, and build_tags_and_nodes parses for nodes (by calling a
	helper), but doesn't report problems encountered there neither.

	[2] For example, with my corrupted file still in place:
	bee# install-info --quiet --section "Disk Management" "Disk Management" /usr/share/info/parted.info.gz && echo success success
	bee# info parted
        info: Cannot find node `Top'.
	-------------------------------------------------------------------
	Concerning [1]: This could also fix the problem of bug 234848 where
	the man page of top is shown instead of the TOP (dir)
	Concerning [2]: Bug should be cloned and reassigned to the program
	providing install-info, i.e. dpkg.

244506 info: menu lacks icon
	umpf, maybe once

245673 info: return the first non-exact match instead of the last
	email sent to submitter
	patch available, does it work?

267357: make Info index: Name Index vs. Concept Index
	Still present, check?

276547: texinfo: @samp{} text should change - to \- in man pages
	no idea what this should do

308063 @xref in man pages can expand to nothing
	not checked

335016	makeinfo --xml generates a document with an invalid DTD
	has to be checked, Karl installed a new DTD which hopefully fixes
	this problem
	Still work to do
