    the formats, and the new teTeX will not need to generate texinfo formats.
    Thus bug #253124 will not be fixed. (Closes: #253124)

  * New upstream version.
  * Includes a newer, changed texinfo.tex that seems fix the PDF links,
    closes: #111563.
  * Eli Zaretskii's patches to info/echo-area.c for case (in)sensitivity
    in indices are applied upstream, closes: #122594 and the patch for
    cross-references on the second line, too, closes: #122600.
  * Fixed the thinko in makeinfo/insertion.c comment, ignored the non-issue
    with harmless extra <br>s, closes: #77885.

    the "info --vi-keys libc:exit" segfault, closes: #79091.

    from #79091.
  * Fixed the spelling error (though not overly convinced), closes: #124757.
  * Patched doc/Makefile* to install the missing directory, and to distclean
    the info files. Feh! Hopefully automakeisms don't shit themselves all
    over the place in the buildd trees and cause the package not to build.
  * Leave our first epsf.tex in place, it's almost the same as the
    tetex-base one but there must be some reason why it exists. <ponder>
  * Put infokey into the info package.

texinfo (4.0b-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version, includes majority of our old patches. It also
    includes support for splitting HTML output files, which closes: #41403.
  * Removed epsf.tex from this package because tetex already ships it,
    closes: #84426. The duplicate file problem didn't appear before because
    previous versions put the file in a different location. Maybe we're
    just making a mess of this.
  * Added willy's patch to fix (not) printing --speech-friendly when printf
    is a macro like with the new gcc, closes: #91350.
  * Packaging polishing.

    the above four bugs.
  * Run 'mktexlsr /usr/share/texmf >/dev/null' (conditionally and only on
    new installations) in texinfo's postinst, because we place files in that

texinfo (4.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Another, even more nifty configure option to make it install in FHS
    compliant directories (this time borrowed from nasm's rules file :)
  * Standards-Version: 3.1.1. Added Build-Depends:.
  * Removed --with-included-gettext from configure flags, useless.
  * Removed --description and --section from all install-info arguments,
    to have install-info pick-up the INFO-DIR-ENTRY from the info files
    themselves. This way, all the sub-apps have entries, which closes: #51425.
  * Install 'info.info', too (why that wasn't done before, is beyond me).

    debian/{info.files,rules} to match the new state.

texinfo (3.12s-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Conforms to policy 3.x, which includes move to FHS etc. Required
    using debhelper 2.0.40, and some other changes to debian/* .
  * Added "-e" to /bin/sh in all maintainer scripts.
  * Replaced "Replaces:" with "Conflicts:" for tetex-{base,bin} in
    texinfo, because the new package has some files in locations that
    don't work well with those old versions of teTeX. Thanks to Lalo
    Martins for noticing this.
  * Removed DEFAULT_INFOPATH defining from the rules file, it's pointless
    (and it didn't work, either :). The one in filesys.h is good enough.

texinfo (3.12i-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * After some discussion with Christoph Martin, the teTeX maintainer,
    and other people from the debian-devel list, we decided to start
    providing all texinfo binaries from this source package.
  * Added new binary package, texinfo, which Replaces: tetex-bin (<< 1.0)
    and Suggests: tetex-bin (because of texi2dvi). For that reason,
    patched util/texi2dvi to exit if no tex found, with an explanation.
  * Removed install-info* and dir files from binary packages.
  * Removed obsolete README.Debian, added other upstream documentation.
  * Updated debian/copyright with additional licence/copyright info.

  * Upgraded from 3.9 to new upstream release 3.12 
  * Non-maintainer release, this time with a proper -0.1 version.
  * This does not use the patches against the files info/infomap.c,
    info/session.c and util/texi2dvi from the previous Debian version.
    According to James Troup, their functionality has been integrated into
    the upstream source so that the patches are indeed obsolete.
