Description: Documentation system for on-line information and printed output
 Texinfo is a documentation system that uses a single source file to
 produce both on-line information and printed output.
 .
 Using Texinfo, you can create a printed document with the normal features
 of a book, including chapters, sections, cross references, and indices. 
 From the same Texinfo source file, you can create a menu-driven, on-line
 Info file with nodes, menus, cross references, and indices.

Description: Standalone GNU Info documentation browser
 The Info file format is an easily-parsable representation for online
 documents. This program allows you to view Info documents, like the
 ones stored in /usr/share/info.
 .
 Much of the software in Debian comes with its online documentation in
 the form of Info files, so it is most likely you will want to install it.
