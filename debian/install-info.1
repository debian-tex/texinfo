.SH SYNOPSIS
.B install-info
.I "[options]"
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.BR install-info
command.
This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
because the original script was designed for Debian packaging system.
.PP
.B install-info
is a wrapper around GNU install-info. If it is called from a normal
shell or script it acts like GNU install-info by forwarding all options
to ginstall-info.
.PP
If it is called from a maintainer script it gives a warning to rebuild
packages and does nothing, since info file installation is now done
via triggers.
.SH OPTIONS
Same as with GNU install-info, see ginstall-info(1).
.SH AUTHOR
This manual page was written by Norbert Preining <preining@logic.at>,
