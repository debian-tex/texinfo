This directory contains documentation on the Texinfo system and the TeX
sources needed to process Texinfo sources.

The .tex files are not installed automatically because TeX
installations vary so widely.  Installing them in the wrong place
would give a false sense of security.  So to allow "\input texinfo"
in your Texinfo files to find the correct version of texinfo.tex,
you should simply cp *.tex to the appropriate place.

If your installation follows the TeX Directory Structure
standard (http://tug.org/tds/), this place will be the directory
TEXMF/tex/texinfo/ for texinfo.tex, and TEXMF/tex/generic/epsf/ for
epsf.tex, where TEXMF is a root of a TeX hierachy.

It is possible to put these .tex files in a `local' place instead
of overwriting existing ones.  You might find  where this is by running
`kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFLOCAL'.

If you add files to your TeX installations, not just replace existing
ones, you very likely will also have to update your ls-R file; do
this by running the mktexlsr command.

For information on how or where to install files, see your TeX documentation
in general (i.e. web2c and kpathsea manuals), and the texmf.cnf file.

An alternative is to copy texinfo.tex to the same directory as your
Texinfo manual, but this is not especially recommended.

You can get the latest texinfo.tex from
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/texinfo/texinfo.tex (and all GNU mirrors)
ftp://tug.org/tex/texinfo.tex (and all CTAN mirrors)
or from the gnulib project on Savannah (among other places).
If you have problems with the texinfo.tex in this distribution, please check
for a newer version.
