output of texi2any.  This work was done by Matthieu Lirzin in 2017.

See https://www.gnu.org/software/soc-projects/ideas-2017.html#texinfo
and http://mathieu.lirzin.emi.u-bordeaux.fr/categories/gsoc/ for some

Running "make examples" used to build the provided examples, but
now you can use INFO_JS_DIR instead - see the Texinfo manual.

To check the result of EXAMPLE:

  firefox examples/EXAMPLE-html/index.html

See the "HACKING" file for information about the development of this
