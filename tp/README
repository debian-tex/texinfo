Texinfo::Parser (tp) is a Perl module for parsing Texinfo code into a 
tree representing the Texinfo code structure.

These other modules and libraries are required.  All have been standard
parts of Perl for years, at least since 5.7.3.
  Carp, Config, Data::Dumper, Encode, File::Basename, File::Spec
  Getopt::Long, Unicode::Normalize, Storable

It also uses the less widely-available modules:
  Locale::Messages, Unicode::EastAsianWidth, Text::Unidecode
For these, internal versions are included, and are installed and used as
part of Texinfo (not disturbing the Perl installation at all).

To run the tests you also need:
  Test::More, Data::Compare, Test::Deep
On Debian-based distros, Test::More is part of perl-modules and thus 
installed with perl, the packages corresponding to the other modules
are named:
  libdata-compare-perl libtest-deep-perl


This module is part of GNU Texinfo.  A standalone Perl module may also be
produced from within the the Texinfo tree, using 
  ./maintain/prepare_perl_module.sh
The resulting module, although standalone, should always be regenerated
from the sources in Texinfo, to avoid divergence of sources.
