Texinfo::Parser (hence the directory name tp) is a Perl module for
parsing Texinfo code into a tree representing the Texinfo code
structure.

These other modules and libraries are required (all have been standard
parts of Perl for years, at least since 5.7.3):
  Carp, Config, Data::Dumper, Encode, File::Basename, File::Spec
  Getopt::Long, Unicode::Normalize, Storable

It also uses the less widely-available modules:
  Locale::Messages, Unicode::EastAsianWidth, Text::Unidecode
For these, internal versions are included, and are installed and used as
part of Texinfo (not disturbing the Perl installation at all).

To run the tests you also need:
  Test::More, Data::Compare, Test::Deep
On Debian-based distros, Test::More is part of perl-modules and thus 
installed with perl, the packages corresponding to the other modules
are named:
  libdata-compare-perl libtest-deep-perl


This module is part of GNU Texinfo.  A standalone Perl module may also be
produced from within the the Texinfo tree, using 
  ./maintain/prepare_perl_module.sh
The resulting module, although standalone, should always be regenerated
from the sources in Texinfo, to avoid divergence of sources.


If you want to delve into making a new backend, the documentation in
tp/Texinfo/Convert/Converter.pm is a good starting point, as it
describes the existing backends and other places to look.  To do a good
job, expect to spend a lot of time making it do the right thing with the
existing tests.
