Profiling
=========

profiling: package on debian:
libdevel-nytprof-perl
In doc:
perl -d:NYTProf ../tp/texi2any.pl texinfo.texi
nytprofhtml --open
# firefox nytprof/index.html


Delayed bugs
============

In @inline* ignore arguments, @value and user macros should not be
expanded.  For example

 @set closebrace }

 @inlinefmt{html,
 truc @value{closebrace}
 machin

In Plaintext, @quotation text should have the right margin narrowed.

Text after @bye should be kept as is when redoing Texinfo.

@-commands in index entries are transliterated when sorting, they should
certainly be converted to unicode instead.

Sorting of index entries should be locale dependent and sort properly
unicode sorting.
my $collator = Unicode::Collate::Locale->new('locale' => $locale_name, 'normalization' => 'NFKD')
@sorted = $collator->sort(@not_sorted);

Currently there is no error for something like 

  @chapter @code{@anchor{TTO}}

there should be an error as for the following construct:

  @chapter @anchor{TTez}

This would certainly imply adding, on top of the 'context_stack', a 
stack of opened @-commands (although maybe not every @-commands?).  This 
would allow to catch many other dubious nesting, such as @table in @menu, 
@caption in @caption and also would certainly allow to handle the 2 cases 
below.  This should, however, slow down the computation even more.

maybe checking for incorrectly nested @titlepage, @copying and 
@documentdescription (which is already done in the "regions stack") 
could be done the same way.

warn nested footnotes.

Following should be an error:
@example
@heading A heading
@end example
Example in heading/heading_in_example.

Similar, but not exactly the same issue, there is no warning with a
block command between @def* and @def*x, only for paragraph.

 @defun a b c d e f 

 @itemize @minus
 truc
 @item t
 @end itemize

 @defunx g h j k l m

 @end defun



Punctuation and spaces before @image do not lead to a doubling of space.
In fact @image is completly formatted outside of usual formatting containers.
Not sure what should be the right way?
test in info_test/image_and_punctuation

There should be a warning for something like
@example text
...

Image on sectioning command line haven't their length ignored correctly.
Not sure it is a big deal.  An example in sectioning/at_commands_in_refs.

warn when a @noindent/@indent appears within a paragraph.

in info_tests/error_in_footnote there is an error message for each 
listoffloats;  Line numbers are right, though, so maybe this is not
an issue.

converters_tests/things_before_setfilename there is no error
for anchor and footnote before setfilename.  It is not completly
clear that there should be, though.

Recursive expansion of @value may lead to an infinite loop.  Wait for
marksource to proceed.

Missing tests
=============

Test node files that differ only in case.  This may be rather complicated,
however, as http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?38380 shows.  This may be linked
to a possible test of CASE_INSENSITIVE_FILENAMES.

Unit test of end_line_count for Texinfo/Convert/Paragraph.pm .... containers.

In html test empty @top for title, with different cases for 
setcontentsaftertit* and for anchors.

Test @sc{@aa{}} and @sc{@'e} in HTML with 8bit and utf8, with and without
enable encoding and entities.

in html test footnotestyle separate.  There are such tests in tp/tests,
maybe they are sufficient, but they are only done for long checks.

anchor in flushright, on an empty line, with a current byte offset.

Future features
===============

Update Unicode-EastAsianWidth.  The new version has improved tests
and a new license, but no functional change.  So maybe wait a
bit to update.

Add some elements of texinfo that are not of interest in the
tree, like beginning and end of included file, @ protecting
end of line in @def*, begin and end of user defined macro
or value expansion.  Maybe call the key for these elements
'sourcemark'?

In a similar way, keep the information about aliases in the tree?
And about @setfilename in included files which is for now completly
removed (consistently with documentation).

Right now VERBOSE is almost not used.

Handle better @exdent in html? (there is a FIXME in the code)

Check the design of the HTML.pm API.  Document the API, in particular
everything in Texinfo::Config.  Add an API for everything used in the 
default functions, for example in page_head, use $self->title_string() 
and so on and so forth.  
Functions to document for HTML API (many more are missing!):
sectioning_command_target_name
node_target_name

Implement what is proposed in HTML Cross Reference Mismatch.

Protection of punctuation in nodes.
in @ref. First : is searched.  if followed by a : the node name is found
and there is no label. When parsing a node a filename with ( is searched for.
Nested parentheses are taken into account.
Then more parentheses?

Automatic generation of node names from section names.  To be protected:
* in every case
  ( at the beginning
* In @node line
  commas
* In menu entry
  * if there is a label
    tab comma dot
  * if there is no label
    :
* In @ref
  commas

In Info

Nodes:
* in every case 
  ( at the beginning
* in Node line 
  commas
* In menu entry and *Note
  * if there is a label
    tab comma dot
  * if there is no label
    :

Labels in Info (which also means index entries)
  :

* at the beginning of a line in a @menu
*note more or less everywhere


DocBook
=======

  deftypevr, deftypecv: use type and not returnvalue for the type

  also informalfigure in @float

  also use informaltable or table, for multitable?

  What is before the first sectioning command is put in <bookinfo><abstract>.

  what about @titlefont in docbook?

  maybe use simpara instead of para. Indeed, simpara is for paragraph without
  block element within, and it should be that way in generated output.

  put <title> in <articleinfo>?

* in docbook, when there is only one section <article> should be better
  than book. Maybe the best way to do that would be passing the
  information that there is only one section to the functions formatting
  the page header and page footer.


Interrogations and remarks
==========================

Instead of _set_global_multiple_commands and _unset_global_multiple_commands
have a better granularity and do something per command, with the possibility
to really revert everything, including things that are not set by set_conf.
(There is a FIXME in the code).  This is not that important, now that the 
actual case that was problematic (setting encodings as a side effect of 
setting @documentencoding) is not supported anymore.  (Now the encoding is
set at the initialization of the converter and should be changed by setting
the correct customization variable, in general OUTPUT_ENCODING_NAME).

Should more Converter ignore the last new line (with type 
last_raw_newline) of a raw block format?

In a first step, close when the the command to be closed is at the 
top of the tree, not when it should be closed theoretically.
Then it could be possible to come back to the place where the command
should be closed and give an error message.
This is certainly only an issue for @footnote and similar not a general issue.

There is no forward looking code anymore, so maybe a lex/yacc parser
could be used for the main loop.  More simply, a binary tokenizer, at 
least, could make for a notable speedup.

def/end_of_lines_protected_in_footnote.pl the footnote is
   (1)  -- category: deffn_name arguments arg2 more args with end of line
and not 
   (1)
 -- category: deffn_name arguments arg2 more args with end of line
It happens this way because the paragraph starts right after the footnote 
number.

in HTML, the argument of a quotation is ignored if the quotation is empty,
as in
 @quotation thing
 @end quotation
Is it really a bug?

In @copying things like some raw formats may be expanded.  However it is
not clear that it should be the same than in the main converter.  Maybe a 
specific list of formats could be passed to Convert::Text::convert, which
would be different (for example Info and Plaintext even if converting HTML).
This requires a test, to begin with.

Use INLINE_INSERTCOPYING as the default for some formats?

In HTML, HEADERS is used.  But not in other modules, especially not in
Plaintext.pm or Info.pm, this is determined by the module used (Plaintext.pm
or Info.pm).  No idea whether it is right or wrong.

in hyphenation: only text and accent commands, and should
only appear in toplevel

use definfoenclose information in Convert::Text?

From vincent Belaïche. About svg image files in HTML:

I don't think that supporting svg would be easy: its seems that to embed an
svg picture you need to declare the width x height of the frame in
which you embed it, and this information cannot be derived quite
straightforwardly from the picture.
With @image you can declare width and height but this is intended for
scaling. I am not sure whether or not that these arguments can be used
for the purpose of defining that frame...
What I did in 5x5 is that coded the height of the frame directly in
the macro @FIGURE with which I embed the figure, without going through
an argument.
The @FIGURE @macro is, for html:
@macro FIGURE {F,W}
@html
<div align="center">
<embed src="5x5_\F\.svg" height="276"
 type="image/svg+xml"
 pluginspage="http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/" /></div>
@end html
@end macro

Add @value to the corresponding commands categories?

tests .init file not relevant since indices cannot be split anymore
indices/index_test.init     

Use of specialized synopsis in DocBook is not a priority and it is not even 
obvious that it is interesting to do so.  The following notes explain the
possibilities and issues extensively.

Instead of synopsis it might seem to be relevant to use specialized synopsis, 
funcsynopsis/funcprototype for deftype* and some def*, and other for object 
oriented.  There are many issues such that this possibility do not appear
appealing at all.

1) there is no possibility to have a category.  So the category must be 
   added somewhere as a role= or in the *synopsisinfo, or this should only
   be used for specialized @def, like @defun.

2) @defmethod and @deftypemethod cannot really be mapped to methodsynopsis
   as the class name is not associated with the method as in Texinfo, but 
   instead  the method should be in a class in docbook.

3) From the docbook reference for funcsynopsis
  "For the most part, the processing application is expected to
  generate all of the parentheses, semicolons, commas, and so on
  required in the rendered synopsis. The exception to this rule is
  that the spacing and other punctuation inside a parameter that is a
  pointer to a function must be provided in the source markup."

  So this mean it is language specific (C, as said in the docbook doc)
  and one have to remove the parentheses, semicolons, commas.

  See also the mails from Per Bothner bug-texinfo, Sun, 22 Jul 2012 01:45:54.

specialized @def, without a need for category:
@defun and @deftypefun 
<funcsynopsis><funcprototype><funcdef>TYPE <function>NAME</function><paramdef><parameter>args</parameter></paramdef></funcprototype></funcsynopsis>

specialized @def, without a need for category, but without DocBook synopsis
because of missing class:
@defmethod, @deftypemethod: methodsynopsis cannot be used since the class
is not available
@defivar and @deftypeivar: fieldsynopsis cannot be used since the class
is not available

Generic @def with a need for a category
For deffn deftypefn (and defmac?, defspec?), the possibilities of 
funcsynopsis, with a category added could be used:
  <funcsynopsis><funcprototype><funcdef role=...>TYPE <function>NAME</function></funcdef><paramdef>PARAMTYPE <parameter>PARAM</parameter></paramdef></funcprototype></funcsynopsis>

Alternatively, use funcsynopsisinfo for the category.

Generic @def with a need for a category, but without DocBook synopsis because
of missing class:
@defop and @deftypeop: methodsynopsis cannot be used since the class
is not available
defcv, deftypecv: fieldsynopsis cannot be used since the class
is not available

Remaining @def without DocBook synopsis because there is no equivalent, 
and requires a category
defvr (defvar, defopt), deftypevr (deftypevar)
deftp



Missing test outputs as files in t/
===================================

output files split (node or not split) could be interesting +texi2html 
style for some tests.  However, the test suite is already too long to
run so such additions should be done with caution.
