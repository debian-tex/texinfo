Delayed bugs
============

From https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Using-gettextized-software.html
For locales, the encoding part is normalized in a specific way.  It
seems that iconv in the C library follows the same convention at least to
some extent, though it is not visibly documented.
Should we use fully the normalization of documentencoding following in some
context (gdt?):
  The normalized codeset value is generated from the user-provided character set name by applying the following rules:

    Remove all characters besides numbers and letters.
    Fold letters to lowercase.
    If the same only contains digits prepend the string "iso".

  So all of the above names will be normalized to iso88591. This allows the program user much more freedom in choosing the locale name.


hyphenation: should only appear in toplevel.


Some dubious nesting could be warned against.  The parsers context
command stacks could be used for that.

Some erroneous constructs not already warned against:

 @table in @menu

 @example
 @heading A heading
 @end example
 Example in heading/heading_in_example.

 @group outside of @example  (maybe there is no need for command stack for
                              this one if @group can only appear directly
                              in @example).

There is no warning with a block command between @def* and @def*x,
only for paragraph.  Not sure that this can be detected with
the context command stack.

 @defun a b c d e f

 @itemize @minus
 truc
 @item t
 @end itemize

 @defunx g h j k l m

 @end defun


Modules included in tp/maintain/lib/ need to be updated from time to
time.


HTML5 validation tidy errors that do not need fixing
----------------------------------------------------

# to get only errors:
tidy -qe *.html

Some can also be validation errors in other HTML versions.

missing </a> before <a>
discarding unexpected </a>
nested <a> which happens for @url in @xref, which is valid Texinfo.

Warning: <a> anchor "..." already defined
Should only happen with multiple insertcopying.

Warning: trimming empty <code>
Normally happens only for invalid Texinfo, missing @def* name, empty
@def* line...

<td> attribute "width" not allowed for HTML5
<th> attribute "width" not allowed for HTML5
These attributes are obsolete (though the elements are 
still part of the language), and must not be used by authors.
The CSS replacement would be style="width: 40%".
However, width is kept as an attribute in texi2nay output and not
as CSS because it is not style, but table or even line specific formatting.


Missing tests
=============

Unit test of end_line_count for Texinfo/Convert/Paragraph.pm .... containers.

anchor in flushright, on an empty line, with a current byte offset.


Future features
===============

For converters in C, agreed with Gavin that it is better not to
translate a perl tree in input, but access directly the C tree that
was setup by the XS parser.


It would probably be good and maybe ease C converters to have a
Texinfo::Document package which encapsulates the information associated
to a document, the tree, and all the other information given by
the parser, indices_information, floats_information,
internal_references_information, global_commands_information,
global_information and labels_information as they are a property of a Texinfo
Document, in addition to being, in general, states of a parser.  The
information set by some calls to Structuring would also probably fit there
naturally.  A member of the package/class would be initialized after the
parsing, but not necessarily for all the function, maybe only parse_texi_text
and parse_texi_file.


For Paragraph, improvements and synchronizations of
the two implementations.  It would be nice to change the XS code
to operate on multiple spans of characters at once when relevant,
we'd have an extra step of keeping track of how long each span of
text is, and then processing that span of text together (in the loop
in xspara_add_text).  It could potentiall have performance benefits
(e.g. reducing the number of function calls) and be easier to debug,
with fewer steps in the processing to trace.  The XS code is easier
to read for the ens of sentence handling part, so for that part, it
could be relevant to use the XS code as reference and change the perl
Paragraph.


From Gavin on the preamble_before_beginning implementation:
Another way might be to add special input code to trim off and return
a file prelude.  This would moves the handling of this from the "parser" code
to the "input" code.  This would avoid the problematic "pushing back" of input
and would be a clean way of doing this.  It would isolate the handling of
the "\input" line from the other parsing code.

I understand that the main purpose of the preamble_before_beginning element
is not to lose information so that the original Texinfo file could be
regenerated.  If that's the case, maybe the input code could return
all the text in this preamble as one long string - it wouldn't have to be
line by line.


See message/thread from Reißner Ernst: Feature request: api docs

Add in_math (for \) as flag in command_data.txt?

Right now VERBOSE is almost not used.

Should we warn if output is on STDOUT and OUTPUT_ENCODING_NAME != MESSAGE_OUTPUT_ENCODING_NAME?

Handle better @exdent in html? (there is a FIXME in the code)

Implement what is proposed in HTML Cross Reference Mismatch.

For plaintext, implement an effect of NO_TOP_NODE_OUTPUT
* if true, output some title, possibly based on titlepage
  and do not output the Top node.
* if false, current output is ok
Default is false.

In Plaintext, @quotation text could have the right margin narrowed to be more
in line with other output formats.

Punctuation and spaces before @image do not lead to a doubling of space.
In fact @image is completly formatted outside of usual formatting containers.
Not sure what should be the right way?
test in info_test/image_and_punctuation

in info_tests/error_in_footnote there is an error message for each
listoffloats;  Line numbers are right, though, so maybe this is not
an issue.

converters_tests/things_before_setfilename there is no error
for anchor and footnote before setfilename.  It is not completly
clear that there should be, though.

In Info, image special directive on sectioning command line length
is taken into account for the underlying characters line count inserted
below the section title.  There is no reason to underline the image
special directive.  Since the image rendering and length of replacement
text depends on the Info viewer, howere, there is no way to know in
advance the lenght of text to underline (if any).  It is therefore unclear
what would be the correct underlying characters count.
An example in formats_encodings/at_commands_in_refs.

Many strings in debugging output are not encoded.  Not clear that it is
an issue.  For example with
/usr/bin/perl -w ./..//texi2any.pl  --force --conf-dir ./../t/init/ --conf-dir ./../init --conf-dir ./../ext -I ./coverage/ -I coverage// -I ./ -I . -I built_input --error-limit=1000 -c TEST=1  --output coverage//out_parser/formatting_macro_expand/ --macro-expand=coverage//out_parser/formatting_macro_expand/formatting.texi -c TEXINFO_OUTPUT_FORMAT=structure ./coverage//formatting.texi --debug=1 2>t.err


DocBook
-------

  deftypevr, deftypecv: use type and not returnvalue for the type

  also informalfigure in @float

  also use informaltable or table, for multitable?

  Add an @abstract command or similar to Texinfo?
  And put in DocBook <abstract>?  Beware that DocBook abstract is quite
  limited in term of content, only a title and paragraphs.  Although block
  commands can be in paragraphs in DocBook, it is not the case for Texinfo,
  so it would be very limited.

  what about @titlefont in docbook?

  maybe use simpara instead of para. Indeed, simpara is for paragraph without
  block element within, and it should be that way in generated output.

* in docbook, when there is only one section <article> should be better
  than book. Maybe the best way to do that would be passing the
  information that there is only one section to the functions formatting
  the page header and page footer.

  there is a mark= attribute for itemizedlist element for the initial mark
  of each item but the standard "does not specify a set of appropriate keywords"
  so it cannot be used.


Manual tests
============

Some tests are interesting but are not in the test suite for various
reasons.  It is not really expected to have much regressions with these
tests.  They are shown here for information.  It was up to date in
March 2022, it may drift away as tests files names or content change.


Tests in non utf8 locale
------------------------

In practice these tests were tested in latin1.  They are not
in the may test suite because a latin1 locale cannot be expected
to be present reliably.

./texi2any.pl --force -I tests/ -c TEXINFO_OUTPUT_FORMAT=rawtext tests/formatting/os*_utf8_no_setfilename.texi
output file name is utf8 because the utf8 encoded input file name
is decoded using the locale latin1 encoding keeping the 8bit characters
from the utf8 encoding, and the encoding inside is utf8
consistent with the document encoding.

./texi2any.pl --force -I tests/ -o encodé/raw.txt -c TEXINFO_OUTPUT_FORMAT=rawtext tests/formatting/os*_utf8.texi

Tests in utf8 locales
---------------------

The archive epub file is not tested in the automated tests.

epub for utf8 encoded manual in utf8 locale
./texi2any.pl --force -I tests/ --init ext/epub3.pm tests/formatting/osé_utf8.texi

The following tests require latin1 encoded file names.  Note that it
could be done automatically now with
tp/maintain/copy_change_file_name_encoding.pl.
However, there is already a test with an include file in latin1, it
is enough.
./texi2any.pl tex_encod*_latin1.texi

The following tests not important enough to have regression test

Notes on classes names in HTML
==============================

In january 2022 the classes in HTML elements were normalized.  There are no
rules, but here is descriptions of the choices made at that time in case one
want to use the same conventions.  The objective was to have the link between
@-commands and classes easy to understand, avoid ambiguities, and have ways to
style most of the output.

The class names without hyphen were only used for @-commands, with one
class attribute on an element maximum for each @-command appearing in the
Texinfo source.  It was also attempted to have such a class for all
the @-commands with an effect on output, though the coverage was not perfect,
sometime it is not easy to select an element that would correspond to the
most logical association with the @-command (case of @*ref @-commands with
both a <cite> and a <a href> for example).

Class names <command>-* with <command> a Texinfo @-command name were
only used for classes marking elements within an @-command but in other
elements that the main element for that @-command, in general sub elements.
For example, a @flushright lead to a <div class="flushright"> where the
@flushright command is and to <p class="flushright-paragraph"> for the
paragraphs within the @flushright.

Class names *-<command> with <command> a Texinfo @-command name were
reserved for uses related to @-command <command>.  For example
classes like summary-letter-printindex, cp-entries-printindex or
cp-letters-header-printindex for the different parts of the @printindex
formatting.

def- and -def are used for classes related to @def*, in general without
the specific command name used.

For the classes not associated with @-commands, the names were selected to
correspond to the role in the document rather than to the formatting style.


In HTML, some @-commands do not have an element with a class associated, or the
association is not perfect.  There is @author in @quotation, @-command affected
by @definfoenclose.  @pxref and similar @-commands have no class for references
to external nodes, and don't have the 'See ' in the element for references to
internal nodes.  In general, it is because gdt() is used instead of direct
HTML.


Notes on protection of punctuation in nodes (done)
==================================================

This is implemented, in tp/Texinfo/Transformations.pm in _new_node for
Texinfo generation, and in Info with INFO_SPECIAL_CHARS_QUOTE.  *[nN]ote
is not protected, though, but it is not clear it would be right to do.
There is a warning with @strong{note...}.

Automatic generation of node names from section names.  To be protected:
* in every case
  ( at the beginning
* In @node line
  commas
* In menu entry
  * if there is a label
    tab comma dot
  * if there is no label
    :
* In @ref
  commas

In Info

in cross-references. First : is searched.  if followed by a : the node
name is found and there is no label. When parsing a node a filename
with ( is searched for.  Nested parentheses are taken into account.

Nodes:
* in every case
  ( at the beginning
* in Node line
  commas
* In menu entry and *Note
  * if there is a label
    tab comma dot
  * if there is no label
    :

Labels in Info (not index entries, in index entries the last : not in
                a uoted node should be used to determine the end of the
                index entry).
  :

* at the beginning of a line in a @menu
*note more or less everywhere


Interrogations and remarks
==========================

Should more Converter ignore the last new line (with type
last_raw_newline) of a raw block format?

There is no forward looking code anymore, so maybe a lex/yacc parser
could be used for the main loop.  More simply, a binary tokenizer, at
least, could make for a notable speedup.

def/end_of_lines_protected_in_footnote.pl the footnote is
   (1)  -- category: deffn_name arguments arg2 more args with end of line
and not
   (1)
 -- category: deffn_name arguments arg2 more args with end of line
It happens this way because the paragraph starts right after the footnote
number.

in HTML, the argument of a quotation is ignored if the quotation is empty,
as in
 @quotation thing
 @end quotation
Is it really a bug?

In @copying things like some raw formats may be expanded.  However it is
not clear that it should be the same than in the main converter.  Maybe a
specific list of formats could be passed to Convert::Text::convert, which
would be different (for example Info and Plaintext even if converting HTML).
This requires a test, to begin with.

In HTML, HEADERS is used.  But not in other modules, especially not in
Plaintext.pm or Info.pm, this is determined by the module used (Plaintext.pm
or Info.pm).  No idea whether it is right or wrong.

From vincent Belaïche. About svg image files in HTML:

I don't think that supporting svg would be easy: its seems that to embed an
svg picture you need to declare the width x height of the frame in
which you embed it, and this information cannot be derived quite
straightforwardly from the picture.
With @image you can declare width and height but this is intended for
scaling. I am not sure whether or not that these arguments can be used
for the purpose of defining that frame...
What I did in 5x5 is that coded the height of the frame directly in
the macro @FIGURE with which I embed the figure, without going through
an argument.
The @FIGURE @macro is, for html:
@macro FIGURE {F,W}
@html
<div align="center">
<embed src="5x5_\F\.svg" height="276"
 type="image/svg+xml"
 pluginspage="http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/" /></div>
@end html
@end macro

Use of specialized synopsis in DocBook is not a priority and it is not even
obvious that it is interesting to do so.  The following notes explain the
possibilities and issues extensively.

Instead of synopsis it might seem to be relevant to use specialized synopsis,
funcsynopsis/funcprototype for deftype* and some def*, and other for object
oriented.  There are many issues such that this possibility do not appear
appealing at all.

1) there is no possibility to have a category.  So the category must be
   added somewhere as a role= or in the *synopsisinfo, or this should only
   be used for specialized @def, like @defun.

2) @defmethod and @deftypemethod cannot really be mapped to methodsynopsis
   as the class name is not associated with the method as in Texinfo, but
   instead  the method should be in a class in docbook.

3) From the docbook reference for funcsynopsis
  "For the most part, the processing application is expected to
  generate all of the parentheses, semicolons, commas, and so on
  required in the rendered synopsis. The exception to this rule is
  that the spacing and other punctuation inside a parameter that is a
  pointer to a function must be provided in the source markup."

  So this mean it is language specific (C, as said in the docbook doc)
  and one have to remove the parentheses, semicolons, commas.

  See also the mails from Per Bothner bug-texinfo, Sun, 22 Jul 2012 01:45:54.

specialized @def, without a need for category:
@defun and @deftypefun
<funcsynopsis><funcprototype><funcdef>TYPE <function>NAME</function><paramdef><parameter>args</parameter></paramdef></funcprototype></funcsynopsis>

specialized @def, without a need for category, but without DocBook synopsis
because of missing class:
@defmethod, @deftypemethod: methodsynopsis cannot be used since the class
is not available
@defivar and @deftypeivar: fieldsynopsis cannot be used since the class
is not available

Generic @def with a need for a category
For deffn deftypefn (and defmac?, defspec?), the possibilities of
funcsynopsis, with a category added could be used:
  <funcsynopsis><funcprototype><funcdef role=...>TYPE <function>NAME</function></funcdef><paramdef>PARAMTYPE <parameter>PARAM</parameter></paramdef></funcprototype></funcsynopsis>

Alternatively, use funcsynopsisinfo for the category.

Generic @def with a need for a category, but without DocBook synopsis because
of missing class:
@defop and @deftypeop: methodsynopsis cannot be used since the class
is not available
defcv, deftypecv: fieldsynopsis cannot be used since the class
is not available

Remaining @def without DocBook synopsis because there is no equivalent,
and requires a category
defvr (defvar, defopt), deftypevr (deftypevar)
deftp
