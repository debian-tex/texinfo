	      ~~  Text::Unidecode TODO file  ~~

TODO: make the table files be built from the Unicode character
database, transitioning from the values in the current table files.
I used to have a whole bunch of concise files that compiled to
the xXX.pm table files.  But they're in a file format I
haven't dealt with since 2001, so screw it all, I'm starting
from zero and it will be... well, you'll see.

(Presumably the Hangul and the Unihan blocks are outside the
scope of that whole ruckus of named characters.)


TODO GTD:
Keep plugging in suggestions from Tomaž Šolc's message


TODO:
Figure out how to courteously declare dependencies in my Makefile.PL

TODO:
Bundle with a "unidecode" util that calls a routine in Unidecode.pm?
Or maybe just show it as a one-liner in the POD?

TODO:
Also show it with an example use with iconv

TODO:
Plow through more bug reports, applying patches etc,
especially stuff from that nice Tomaž Šolc man.

TODO:

***DEFINITELY*** Make it handle stuff in Astral Plane (over U+FFFF)
Take that plunge, or ascend into the plane, or whatever.  DOIT.

TODO:

Currently, all the files are in Unix newline format (LF).
Maybe CR+LF is technically more universal, and I could switch
to that.  But so far I've gotten no complaints that I should
go do that.

TODO:

THEN re-run the thing that reads the Unihan database and generates
all the Text/Unidecode/__.pm files.
(Do the hyperspace handling first, because lots of Unihan
stuff is up there.)

TODO:

Look to see whether I need to deal with the Arabic stuff in
the U+FBxx etc blocks.  I thought it was always just
font-internal stuff, but I'm starting to suspect that it may
be encountered in the real world

TODO:

Of course:
- Check for new glyphs in existing tables.
- Look at whole new tables (like the Philippine scripts) in
normal space (x < U+FFFF)
- Look at the wild wilderness in hyperspace (x > U+FFFF
