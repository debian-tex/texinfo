=item $converter = Texinfo::Convert::OUTFORMAT->converter($options)

Initialize converter from Texinfo to OUTFORMAT.

The I<$options> hash reference holds Texinfo customization options for the
converter.  These options should be Texinfo customization options
that can be passed to the converter.  Most of the customization options are
described in the Texinfo manual or in the customization API manual.  Those
customization options, when appropriate, override the document content.

See L<Texinfo::Convert::Converter> for more information.

described in the Texinfo manual.

Convert a Texinfo parsed document I<$document> and return the resulting output.

=item $result = $converter->convert_tree($tree)
