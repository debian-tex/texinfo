See also the tests in the tp/tests directory.


These tests are run by "make check" under tp/.  (The test files are 
listed in tp/Makefile.tres, which is a generated file.)  A single .t 
test file can be run on its own with

  perl -w t/03coverage_braces.t

Another way, which works when doing an out-of-source build, is

  make check TESTS=t/03coverage_braces.t

Most test files use a testing infrastructure from t/test_utils.pl.
The run_all function from that file runs the tests that have been 
specified.

In that case the reference output files for the test of a test category 
$test_category.t file are in t/results/$test_category/.  For example, if 
after running "make check" test-suite.log contains a line like:

FAIL: t/03coverage_braces.t 324 - test_image converted html

you can see the difference between the expected and actual output with

  diff t/results/coverage_braces/test_image.pl{,.new}

(Any number at the start of the name of the test, like "03" in this
example, is removed.)

To review all the differences for one of the *.t test files, you can do:

  for f in t/results/coverage_braces/*.pl; do echo --------; echo \
  Differences in $f; diff $f{,.new}; done | less

The reference files are regenerated with the -g option given to the .t 
file, as in

  perl -w t/03coverage_braces.t -g

To regenerate a specific test reference file, the test name should be 
given as an argument.  For example, to just regenerate the reference 
files for the "test_image" test within t/03.coverage_braces.t, run

  perl -w t/03coverage_braces.t -g test_image

Some tests under this directory use input files in the 'input_files' 
subdirectory.  When adding a test that uses an input file, add its path 
to tp/Makefile.am.

For some tests, as well as a .pl file as usual in results/*/, actual
output files are generated.  For those tests, there are directories with
reference test results (with names prefixed with res_), and directories
with the obtained results (with names prefixed with out_).  For example,
many of the tests whose results are in the 'results/indices' directory
follow this format.  (The same convention is used by the test suite in
../tests.)

Tests can be managed using the script in ../maintain/all_tests.sh.  For
example, "./maintain/all_tests.sh generate" regenerates all of the
reference test results (run from the upper-level directory), and
"./maintain/all_tests.sh diff" makes a diff of all resulting files
against references.

From the top directory, you can also create texinfo files corresponding to
tests by running something along the lines of:

  perl -w t/60macro.t -c

to create a file for each of the tests in t/60macro.t, or for a specific
test, here arg_body_expansion_order: 

  perl -w t/60macro.t -c arg_body_expansion_order

The output files will be created with -o, in t/output_files/$test_category/

When adding Perl (sub)tests under t/, also run
maintain/regenerate_file_lists.pl and/or maintain/prepare_perl_module_files.sh
to regenerate MANIFEST and/or maintain/MANIFEST_generated_files, or a 
"plan" (aka results file) will be missing at distcheck.
