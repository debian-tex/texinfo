\input texinfo @c -*-texinfo-*-

@c this document is setup to detect when the documentlanguage was not
@c set according to command line, but according to document.  This
@c is important to test that in the Parser, as converters initialized with
@c Texinfo::Convert::Converter converter() and with values accessed by
@c get_conf() will use the command line.
@c This is tricky to demonstrate, as documentlanguage is not used much
@c in Parser.  It is used in two places to set the documentlanguage extra
@c value, 
@c 1) for the untranslated type, for the prefix of @def* and 
@c 2) for the @def* line commands with added index entries that need to 
@c    be translated, like '{name} of {class}'.
@c The untranslated type is in general translated in the converters
@c without using the extra documentlanguage key value, so getting it 
@c wrong does not have any consequence.
@c The @def* translated added indices are translated relatively early,
@c before the converter, and the extra documentlanguage key is used to
@c get the language, so if the wrong language is set, it will show up
@c in the index generated by @printindex.
