All the files here are maintained as part of the Texinfo distribution
(in contrast to the contrib/ directory).

These scripts actually get installed:
  texi2dvi texi2pdf pdftexi2dvi
  (along with *.bat on Windows)
  Also the XML stuff: texinfo.dtd texinfo.cat.

These are examples of wrapping makeinfo invocation to achieve their
various jobs:
  detexinfo texi-elements-by-size txicmdlist txicustomvars txixml2texi

The srclist.txt file specifies common source files to keep in sync; see
the srclist-update script in gnulib.

Finally, the gendocs script and templates (which are not installed) are
about creating all the usual output formats to be put on web pages.
