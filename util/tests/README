Perhaps some day we will actually make these work.  We can't just invoke
them unconditionally, since people may or may not have working TeX
installations.  And even  checking whether it is working or not is not
simple.

The txitextest script compares old and new results of running manuals
through texinfo.tex.  The texinfo.tex developer(s) run this from cron
nightly as an imperfect check against errors and/or reversions creeping in.
